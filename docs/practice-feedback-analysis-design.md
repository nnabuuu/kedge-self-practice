## 3. Analysis Algorithms

### 3.1 Performance Metrics Calculation

#### Accuracy Score
```typescript
accuracy = (correct_answers / total_questions) * 100
```

#### Speed Percentile
```typescript
// Compare user's average answer time against historical data
speed_percentile = percentile_rank(user_avg_time, all_users_avg_times)
```

#### Consistency Score
```typescript
// Based on standard deviation of answer times
consistency = 100 - min(100, (stddev(answer_times) / mean(answer_times)) * 100)
```

#### Improvement Rate
```typescript
// Compare with average of last 5 sessions
improvement = current_accuracy - average(last_5_sessions_accuracy)
```

### 3.2 Knowledge Point Analysis

#### Strength Identification
```typescript
strengths = knowledge_points.filter(kp => {
  return kp.accuracy >= 85 && kp.attempts >= 3
})
```

#### Weakness Detection
```typescript
weaknesses = knowledge_points.filter(kp => {
  return kp.accuracy < 60 || (kp.accuracy < 70 && kp.declining_trend)
})
```

### 3.3 Difficulty Perception Algorithm
```typescript
function perceiveDifficulty(metrics) {
  const score = (
    metrics.accuracy * 0.4 +
    metrics.consistency * 0.3 +
    (100 - metrics.avg_time_percentile) * 0.3
  )
  
  if (score >= 85) return 'easy'
  if (score >= 70) return 'moderate'
  if (score >= 50) return 'challenging'
  return 'very_challenging'
}
```

## 4. Recommendation Engine

### 4.1 Recommendation Types

#### Review Material
Triggered when:
- Accuracy < 60% on specific knowledge points
- Declining trend detected
- Multiple mistakes on fundamental concepts

#### Practice More
Triggered when:
- 60% ≤ Accuracy < 80%
- Inconsistent performance
- New topic with limited practice

#### Advance Topic
Triggered when:
- Accuracy ≥ 90% consistently
- Mastery of current level demonstrated
- Speed in top 20th percentile

#### Take Break
Triggered when:
- Multiple sessions with declining performance
- Session duration > 2 hours
- Fatigue indicators detected

#### Change Strategy
Triggered when:
- No improvement after 5+ sessions
- Consistent time pressure issues
- Pattern of specific mistake types

### 4.2 Priority Calculation
```typescript
priority = base_priority * urgency_multiplier * personal_weight

where:
- base_priority: Based on recommendation type (1-5)
- urgency_multiplier: Based on performance gap (1.0-2.0)
- personal_weight: Based on user's learning goals (0.5-1.5)
```

## 5. Achievement System

### 5.1 Achievement Categories

#### Performance Achievements
- **First Perfect Score**: 100% accuracy in a session
- **Consistency Champion**: 5 sessions with 80%+ accuracy
- **Speed Demon**: Top 10% in answer speed

#### Engagement Achievements
- **Daily Dedication**: Practice for 7 consecutive days
- **Question Master**: Answer 100/500/1000 questions

- **Early Bird**: Practice before 7 AM

#### Knowledge Achievements
- **Topic Expert**: Master a knowledge point (90%+ accuracy)
- **Well-Rounded**: Score 70%+ across all topics
- **Challenge Conqueror**: Complete difficult question set
- **Error Eliminator**: Review and correct all mistakes

### 5.2 Rarity System
```typescript
const rarityThresholds = {
  common: { unlock_rate: 0.5 },      // 50% of users
  uncommon: { unlock_rate: 0.3 },    // 30% of users
  rare: { unlock_rate: 0.15 },       // 15% of users
  epic: { unlock_rate: 0.04 },       // 4% of users
  legendary: { unlock_rate: 0.01 }   // 1% of users
}
```

### 5.3 Reward Points Calculation
```typescript
reward_points = base_points * rarity_multiplier * difficulty_bonus

where:
- base_points: 10-50 based on achievement type
- rarity_multiplier: 1x (common) to 10x (legendary)
- difficulty_bonus: 1.0-1.5 based on challenge level
```
