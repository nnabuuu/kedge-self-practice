Number of migrations:       17
Reason: Replaced with consolidated_initial_schema migration

These migrations were the original sequential migrations that built
the schema incrementally. They have been replaced with a single
consolidated migration for better performance and maintainability.

To restore these migrations:
1. Move them back to the kedge_db directory
2. Remove the consolidated_initial_schema directory
3. Re-run migrations sequentially
